# Roadmap for Rennes' import to EPICARD 

For the next batch import, below are several issues:
1. Surgeon's analytics are improperly attributed to the import's investigator.
Instead, Tentelemed suggests to create as many archive as there're of heart
surgeons.  
2. Make sure that *copied* content is calculated only once;
3. Make sure that NAs are properly encoded, e.g., as "2" and not as "NULL";
4. Verify attributes that may drift overtime, e.g., the named list of heart surgeons and their RPPS;
5. Streamline import into EPICARD from the local information system at Rennes' academic hospital.
